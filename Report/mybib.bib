    abstract = { Study Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Objectives To determine the biomechanical differences between foot-strike patterns used when running. Background Strike patterns during running have received attention in the recent literature due to their potential mechanical differences and associated injury risks. Methods Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SciELO, and SPORTDiscus) were searched through July 2014. Studies (cross-sectional, case-control, prospective, and retrospective) comparing the biomechanical characteristics of foot-strike patterns during running in distance runners at least 18 years of age were included in this review. Two independent reviewers evaluated the risk of bias. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used to combine the data from the included studies. Results Sixteen studies were included in the final analysis. In the meta-analyses of kinematic variables, significant differences between forefoot and rearfoot strikers were found for foot and knee angle at initial contact and knee flexion range of motion. A forefoot-strike pattern resulted in a plantar-flexed ankle position and a more flexed knee position, compared to a dorsiflexed ankle position and a more extended knee position for the rearfoot strikers, at initial contact with the ground. In the comparison of rearfoot and midfoot strikers, midfoot strikers demonstrated greater ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and decreased knee flexion range of motion compared to rearfoot strikers. For kinetic variables, the meta-analysis revealed that rearfoot strikers had higher vertical loading rates compared to forefoot strikers. Conclusion There are differences in kinematic and kinetic characteristics between foot-strike patterns when running. Clinicians should be aware of these characteristics to help in the management of running injuries and advice on training. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2015;45(10):738–755.

abstract = {Ground reaction forces and center of pressure (C of P) patterns were studied in 17 subjects running at 4.5 ms−1. The subjects were classified as rearfoot or midfoot strikers according to the location of the C of P at the time of first contact between foot and ground. The C of P path in the rearfoot group showed a continuous anterior movement during support while the C of P in most of the midfoot group migrated posteriorly during the first 20 ms of the support phase. Variability in both groups was most marked during early support. The mean peak to peak force components were 3 BW, 1 BW and 0.3 BW in the vertical, anteroposterior and mediolateral directions respectively. Consistent differences between groups were noted in all three components, but individual differences within a given group were also considerable. The C of P patterns are presented in conjunction with ground reaction force data, and the implications of the results in the areas of running mechanics, shoe design and sports injury are discussed.}

abstract = {Elevated impact loading can be detrimental to runners as it has been linked to the increased risk of tibial stress fracture and plantar fasciitis. The objective of this study was to investigate the combined effects of foot strike pattern, step rate, and anterior trunk lean gait modifications on impact loading in runners. Nineteen healthy runners performed 12 separate gait modification trials involving: three foot strike patterns (rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot strike), two step rates (natural and 10% increased), and two anterior trunk lean postures (natural and 10-degree increased flexion). Overall, forefoot strike combined with increased step rate led to the lowest impact loading rates, and rearfoot strike combined with anterior trunk lean led to the highest impact loading rates. In addition, there were interaction effects between foot strike pattern and step rate on awkwardness and effort, such that it was both more natural and easier to transition to a combined gait modification involving forefoot strike and increased step rate than to an isolated gait modification involving either forefoot strike or increased step rate. These findings could help to inform gait modifications for runners to reduce impact loading and associated injury risks.}
